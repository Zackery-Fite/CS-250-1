### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with understanding the problem from the user's perspective. I focus on gathering requirements through interviews, feedback, or observation to identify
what users truly need, rather than only what they request. Creating user stories helps translate needs into clear and actionable goals. Each user story defines who the user is, what
they achieve and why it matters. They allow me to prioritize features and design software that directly supporst user goals. 

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile process do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs, I like to use an interative and incremental approach by starting small and testing very frequently, incorporating feedback when needed. I plan to incorporate
the Agile processes such as Scrum and Kanban in future projects. THese methods encourage continuous improvement, regular communicationm and adaptability. I find using sprint cycles,
daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to help maintain my focus. They also help to identify blockers early and ensure that the development aligns with the projects goals.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member includes communicating openly and frequently, respecting others' ideas, and contributing to the shared vision of the project. Taking responsibility for my work,
offering help to teammates, helping when teammates are facing challenges, and staying felxible when plans change. Collaboration and trust are the two most important things that lead to 
software development success. Everyone helping each other and leaning on one another leads to a more successful development cycle.
